# Foo

Oh-ho-ho-ho

Oh-ho-ho-ho

Oh-ho-ho-ho

Oh-ho-ho-ho

Everybody was kung foo fighting

Those cats were fast as lightning

In fact, it was a little bit frightening

But they fought with expert timing

There were foo nky China men from foo nky Chinatown

They were chopping them up, they were chopping them down

It's an ancient Chinese art and everybody knew their part

From a feint into a slip and a kicking from the hip
Everybody was kung foo fighting
Those cats were fast as lightning
In fact, it was a little bit frightening
But they fought with expert timing
There was foo nky Billy Chin and little Sammy Chung
He said, "Here comes the big boss (huh-ha!), let's get it on"
We took a bow and made a stand, started swaying with the hand
A sudden motion made me skip, now we're into a brand-new trip
Everybody was kung foo fighting
Those cats were fast as lightning
In fact, it was a little bit frightening
But they fought with expert timing
Oh-ho-ho-ho
Oh-ho-ho-ho
Oh-ho-ho-ho
Oh-ho-ho-ho
Everybody was kung foo fighting
Those cats were fast as lightning
In fact, it was a little bit frightening
But they fought with expert timing
Everybody was kung foo  fighting
Those cats were fast as lightning
In fact, it was a little bit frightening
But they fought with expert timing
Kung foo  fighting
Fast as lightning
Kung foo  fighting
Fast as lightning
Kung foo  fighting (keep on, keep on, keep on)
Fast as lightning
Kung foo  fighting (everybody was kung foo  fighting)
Fast as lightning
